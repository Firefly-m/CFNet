# FCNet: Foreground-guided Consensus Awareness Network for Collaborative Camouflaged Object Detection

Collaborative camouflaged object detection (CoCOD) aims at discovering the camouflaged objects in a group of relevant images.  Mining the camouflaged consistency relations across images is essential for locating collaborative camouflaged objects. The current CoCOD methods do not pay enough attention to the inclusion of information unrelated to co-significant objects in the common representation. Therefore, we propose a foreground-guided Consensus Awareness Network (FCNet) for collaborative camouflaged object detection.

# Training/Testing
The training and testing experiments are conducted using PyTorch with a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 GPU of 24 GB Memory.
Configuring your environment (Prerequisites):

Creating a virtual environment in terminal: conda create -n BGNet python=3.6.

Installing necessary packages: pip install -r requirements.txt.
We will release details about the code as soon as possible.
